          For intermittent issues, please enable debug logging by running the _GitLens: Enable Debug Logging_ command from the Command Palette (<kbd>F1</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl/cmd</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>).
          This will enable logging to the _GitLens_ & _GitLens (Git)_ channels in the _Output_ pane.

          Once enabled, please reproduce the issue, and attach the logs from the _GitLens_ channel, and if its Git related please also attach the logs from the _GitLens (Git)_ channel.

          Thank you!
