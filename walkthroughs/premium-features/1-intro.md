## Introducing GitLens Premium Features

New premium features like Worktrees and Visual File History can be unlocked with a GitLens Free+ account. Additional premium features like a visual commit graph, and integrations for GitHub Enterprise and GitLab are coming soon.

## Does this affect existing features?

No, the introduction of premium features has no impact on existing GitLens features, so you won't lose access to any of the GitLens features you know and love. Creating an account simply gives you access to new, premium features that will enable you to get even more out of Git in VS Code!

Free+ accounts will be able to access premium features on public repos, and a paid account will be required to access premium features on private repos. All non-premium features will continue to be free without an account.
