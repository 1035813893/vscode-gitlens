## Introducing Premium Features

Premium features are all-new, completely optional, features that enhance your current GitLens experience when you sign with an account. Anyone can try premium features for public and private repos for 3 days, without an account.

ðŸ›ˆ Non-premium features are always accessible, without an account, and will continue to evolve and be invested in.

The new Visual File History and Worktrees premium features can be used with a free, GitLens Free+ account. Free+ accounts can use premium features on public repos, while paid accounts can also use them on private repos.

## More premium features coming soon

Additional premium features like a visual commit graph, and integrations for GitHub Enterprise and GitLab are coming soon.

## Does this affect existing features?

No, the introduction of premium features has no impact on existing GitLens features, so you won't lose access to any of the GitLens features you know and love. Creating an account simply gives you access to new premium features that will enable you to get even more out of Git in VS Code!

All non-premium features will continue to be free without an account.
